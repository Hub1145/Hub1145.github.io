<p><strong>Palo Alto, CA, 12th October, 2022, Chainwire</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://boba.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Boba Network</u></a>, the first multichain Layer-2 blockchain and Hybrid Compute platform, deployed its execution layer on Moonbeam to become the first Layer-2 live on Moonbeam. The Moonbeam deployment features <a href="https://firefly.exchange" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Firefly</u></a>, a DEX and perpetual swap platform as a launch partner dApp.</p>



<p>Boba is the first Layer-2 platform launching on Moonbeam. The new Boba-Moonbeam-enabled environment is called BobaBeam. Moonbeam is a smart contract platform designed for the development of cross-chain interoperable applications &nbsp;on Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, and additional smart contract platforms.</p>



<p>BobaBeam will host Firefly, a Moonbeam-native derivatives DEX. Firefly chose to launch on the BobaBeam Layer-2 network to secure its scalability needs, due to the large demand for block space and transaction throughput of such a platform. In a recent 4-day testing period on testnet, Firefly saw 86,635 unique wallets from over 121 countries and 818,031 trades – 136/minute.</p>



<p>Hybrid Compute is one of Boba’s flagship features and is designed to improve smart contract functionality, to create a seamless, interoperable environment for mainstream Web2 developers to bridge to Web3. By leveraging the power of real-world data and off chain compute, developers have access to a host of Web2 APIs that are designed to create an interoperable computation layer that is unlike anything on the market today. All projects and dApps building on the BobaBeam platform are able to leverage Boba Network’s proprietary Hybrid Compute computation network.</p>



<p><b>Alan Chiu, the CEO and Founder of Enya Labs</b> (formerly Enya.ai), and the core contributor to Boba Network, notes that: “We’re very excited to launch on Moonbeam and achieve this key expansion milestone. Because of this integration we believe Moonbeam now has more firepower to offer developers one of the most scalable and interoperable smart contract environments in the industry. We’re truly honored to work with our starting dApps to drive adoption to our combined networks.”</p>



<p>“Moonbeam’s vision is to allow developers to combine functionality from multiple specialized blockchains to help projects scale and improve user experiences,” said <b>Derek Yoo, Founder of Moonbeam</b>. “Boba provides an excellent solution for teams that require high transaction throughput and fast block times. By integrating Boba and Moonbeam, developers now have access to both the scalability and throughput that Boba provides, combined with the interoperability that Moonbeam natively supports.”</p>



<p><b>Zabi Mohebzada, the co-founder of Firefly</b> summarizes the newly developed partnership with Firefly, Moonbeam, and Boba below: &#8220;With the BobaBeam Layer-2 integration, we are excited to bring our decentralized perpetual swap marketplace to the Moonbeam and Polkadot ecosystems” “By leveraging the instant finality and performant trade execution provided by Boba’s infrastructure on Moonbeam, Firefly will offer traders a fast, secure and easy user experience.&#8221;</p>



<p><b>About Boba Network</b></p>



<p><a href="https://boba.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Boba Network</u></a> is a blockchain-enabled Layer-2 scaling solution and Hybrid Compute platform designed to offer lightning fast transaction times and fees up to 60x less than Ethereum. Our Hybrid Compute brings the power of Web2 on-chain, with smarter, more intuitive smart contracts that allow developers and creators to leverage off-chain compute and real-world data to offer an enriched experience unlike anything else on the market today.</p>



<p><b>About Moonbeam</b><br><a href="https://moonbeam.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Moonbeam</u></a> is a smart contract platform for building cross-chain connected applications that provides accessibility to users, assets, and services on any blockchain. By uniting functionality from Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot and other iterations &nbsp;into a single platform, Moonbeam solves today’s fragmented user experience — unlocking true interoperability and paving the way for the next generation of applications. The Moonbeam platform uses integrated cross-chain messaging to allow developers to create smart contracts that access services across many remote blockchains. This approach, plus Moonbeam’s developer-friendly EVM platform, vast tool support, and modern Substrate architecture, creates the ideal development environment for building connected applications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Los Angeles, CA, 12th October, 2022, Chainwire</strong></p>



<p>Takeaways:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://deso.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>DeSo</u></a>, a new blockchain that has raised $200 million from Coinbase, Sequoia, and Andreessen Horowitz, just launched <a href="https://daodao.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>DAODAO</u></a>, a breakthrough cross-chain fundraising platform.</li>



<li><a href="https://daodao.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>DAODAO</u></a> allows entrepreneurs to launch fundraising rounds with coins immediately tradeable on an on-chain order-book exchange.</li>



<li>Founders can raise capital with any currency, including fiat cash, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, DeSo, and USDC, and cash out directly to USDC.</li>



<li>Founders can also access on-chain social features such as on-chain end-to-end encrypted messaging &amp; group chats, on-chain profiles, on-chain content, and an on-chain social graph.</li>
</ul>



<p>Today, the fundraising process for founders is highly-centralized, with a handful of elite venture capitalists controlling who gets funded and who doesn’t. In addition, founders must typically wait ten years or more for their company to “go public” and become traded on a liquid exchange. But that could soon change as blockchains like <a href="https://deso.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>DeSo</u></a> enable founders to raise money from millions of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana users with just the click of a button.</p>



<p>A new app called DAODAO is launching today at the forefront of this disruptive trend. Built on the <a href="https://deso.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>DeSo</u></a> blockchain, backed by Coinbase, Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and others, DAODAO allows any Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana user to invest in promising founders <i>before</i> they go to pitch venture capitalists.</p>



<p>For founders, setting up a fundraiser on DAODAO is as easy as creating a social media account. Funds are automatically converted to USD, and founders can cash out seamlessly to USDC anytime.</p>



<p>However, the most interesting component of DAODAO is that founders can give contributors a liquid token with their purchase, which can immediately trade on DeSo’s decentralized on-chain gas-less order-book exchange.</p>



<p>Such a breakthrough raises the question of whether the traditional fundraising model of waiting ten years for a company to trade on the open market could now be obsolete.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“DeSo is the only blockchain that could support something like DAODAO today,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arash-ghaemi/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Arash Ghaemi,</u></a> Growth Marketing Lead at DeSo. “DeSo’s recent <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/usdc-to-integrate-with-decentralized-social-to-bring-web3-to-the-masses" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>USDC integration</u></a> and the MegaSwap swapping facility to convert crypto into USD were both critical, and no other chain has both. On top of that, DeSo’s order-book exchange is the fastest in the world, capable of performing 40,000 matches per second,” he continues.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>DeSo is also capable of supporting unique social features leveraged by DAODAO, including on-chain profiles and an on-chain social graph. “It costs about $75 to store a 200-character Tweet on Ethereum and about fifteen cents to store it on Solana, Avalanche, or Polygon. In contrast, DeSo is one ten-thousandth of a cent, making it the first blockchain capable of disrupting storage-heavy applications like social fundraising. It really is the Social Layer for all web3,” Founder of DeSo <a href="https://diamondapp.com/u/nader" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Nader Al-Naji </a>adds. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.cryptobanter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/test_1665508017lORgZ52EeE.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>This is the latest in a recent string of successes for DeSo. The platform listed on Coinbase earlier this year announced <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/metamask-integration-unlocks-decentralized-social-for-millions-of-ethereum-users" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>a groundbreaking MetaMask integration</u></a> last week that has caused <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2022/10/01/decentralized-social-deso-outpaces-crypto-market-and-surges-102-this-week-amid-integration-with-metamask/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>a significant price surge</u></a>, and many new social apps like <a href="https://diamondapp.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Diamond</u></a>, a web3 social network built on DeSo, have launched and are growing rapidly with a recent surge in user numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, the platform announced a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/06/decentralized-social-medias-deso-token-rallies-amid-stablecoin-plans/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">USDC integration</a> that has attracted many new builders to the ecosystem, including DAODAO.</p>



<p>With the launch of DAODAO, DeSo’s true disruptive power becomes apparent. It is a platform that can disrupt social media and the trillion-dollar early-stage financing market.</p>

<p>Takeaways:</p>

<li><a href="https://deso.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>DeSo</u></a>, a new blockchain that has raised $200 million from Coinbase, Sequoia, and Andreessen Horowitz, just launched decentralized on-chain end-to-end encrypted group chats, a first-of-its-kind innovation.</li>



<li>On-chain messages are resistant to censorship and can be used pseudonymously without supplying personal information, just like Bitcoin or Ethereum.</li>



<li>DeSo is the only blockchain that supports seamless end-to-end encrypted on-chain messaging today, and the extension to group chats is a first-of-its-kind breakthrough.</li>



<li>Apps like <a href="https://diamondapp.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Diamond</u></a>, a Decentralized Twitter app that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/blockchain-twitter-app-launches-to-bring-decentralized-social-to-the-masses" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>launched recently</u></a>, are launching decentralized encrypted group chats on DeSo in the coming weeks. Diamond already supports end-to-end encrypted on-chain direct messages, which DeSo has featured since early 2021.</li>
</ul>



<p>Today, Signal is the most popular private messaging app, and yet users can&#8217;t use it without entering a personally-identifying piece of information: their phone number. This makes it so that anyone with access to Signal&#8217;s database gets full information about who the user messaging and when. Additionally, because Signal is a centralized service, it has been blocked in major countries like China.</p>



<p>Imagine if creating a Bitcoin wallet required users to give up their phone numbers. Why can&#8217;t users have the same level of privacy and censorship resistance that they have with Bitcoin but applied to their communications?</p>



<p>Today, the <a href="https://deso.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>DeSo</u></a> blockchain brings Bitcoin&#8217;s pseudonymity and censorship resistance to messaging with the launch of decentralized end-to-end encrypted on-chain direct messages and group chats.</p>



<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/metamask-integration-unlocks-decentralized-social-for-millions-of-ethereum-users" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>recent integration with MetaMask</u></a>, users of DeSo apps like <a href="http://diamond" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Diamond</u></a> can sign up without entering any personal information. Additionally, because DeSo is a decentralized layer-1 blockchain, all messages are censorship resistant, meaning that nothing can stop the users recipient from getting their message, even if they&#8217;re in a country with limited free speech.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“DeSo is the only blockchain that could support something like this today,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nader-al-naji-86b14a3a/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Nader Al-Naji</u></a>, the creator of <a href="https://deso.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>DeSo</u></a>. “It costs about $75 to store a 200-character message on Ethereum, and about fifteen cents to store it on Solana, Avalanche, or Polygon.

<p><strong>Greenwich, Conn., 11th October, 2022, Chainwire</strong></p>



<p>Spritz Finance, which recently launched its beta for US residents, has expanded its bill-pay capabilities to support payments with any token on the Polygon network. This is a major step forward in realizing the company’s mission of making crypto useful in the real world for millions of people.</p>



<p>Spritz Finance, a Web3 finance app that lets users pay bills with cryptocurrency directly from their preferred crypto wallets, has launched a new feature to enable TradFi payments with any token on the Polygon network. The feature will let users better integrate their on and off-chain finances, all from one place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spritz beta users in the US can now pay their credit cards, mortgage, utilities, student loans, and more with any token on the Polygon network, including the network’s native currency MATIC – all without having to first swap for stablecoins like USDC.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We knew that our users wanted the option to pay bills with any token, from Polygon’s biggest coins to leveraging any and all on-chain rewards generated from DeFi, blockchain-based gaming, and income earned by working for DAOs,” said Chris Sheehan, Spritz founder and CEO. “This feature is an integral part of the Spritz platform, and saves our customers valuable time and money. By avoiding unnecessary swaps and fees,more people can use their crypto for everyday purchases and monthly expenses seamlessly.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While still in beta, Spritz is open to anyone with a US bill-pay account and crypto held in non-custodian wallets, such as MetaMask and Ledger. Spritz launched on the Polygon network earlier this year, which allows for blazingly fast and cheap payment transactions, where gas fees are typically a penny or less. The company plans to expand its crypto bill pay capabilities to more blockchain networks in the near future.</p>



<p><b>About Spritz Finance</b></p>



<p>Spritz Finance enables IRL bill payments directly from Web3 wallets, on a path to eventually connecting every smart contract and every traditional use of funds in the world, from mortgage payments and credit cards to monthly utility bills. With the company’s first product, customers can make bill payments using any crypto token without needing to offramp through a bank. The company is currently in closed beta, which can be joined from the Spritz website. <a href="https://spritz.finance/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>https://spritz.finance</u></a></p>

<p><strong>Zug, Switzerland, 11th October, 2022, Chainwire</strong></p>



<p>Have a blockchain dApp ready to integrate the most state-of-the-art Oracle? Sign up for Supra’s Network Activation Program (SNAP) for the opportunity to receive free oracle and VRF/RNG credits before the list is full.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Continuing to unveil their growing technology stack, today SupraOracles announces the official launch of its Alpha Testnet. SupraOracles elevates a new standard for the Oracle industry, deploying fully auditable and accurate streaming data feeds with 2-5 second finality. In preparation of this Alpha Testnet, SupraOracles has graciously received gas subsidies and support from seven leading chains. SupraOracles Alpha Testnet is now publishing Oracle data to seven different major blockchains’ testing environments, including various Layer 1s and Layer 2s each minute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following their Oracle service will be their Confidential VRF (Verifiable Random Function) service, which utilizes novel cryptography to ensure unbiased, privacy-preserving, fair randomness generation to power NFTs, GameFi, and more. Node operators interested in participating in the Incentivized Beta Testnet should <a href="https://discord.io/supraoracles" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>reach out on Discord</u></a>.</p>



<p>To utilize SupraOracles today, developers can review deployments on <a href="https://data.supraoracles.com/networks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>seven prominent blockchains</u></a>: Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Binance, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon. Additional ecosystems will be serviced in the months to come; including, but not limited to: Algorand, Fantom, Harmony, ImmutableX, Moonbeam, Solana, StarkWare, and Sui.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SupraOracles welcomes developers from any of these ecosystems to dive into the <a href="https://supraoracles.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>latest documentation</u></a> in order to start integrating today. Bug bounties await the most eager participants.</p>

SNAP Partners will receive up to two years’ worth of oracle and VRF/RNG expenses complimentarily once SupraOracles goes live on Mainnet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SNAP aims to help promising Web3 projects more easily achieve scale. There are also other beneficial incentive packages following the initial discount window. As SNAP is in high demand, <a href="https://join.supraoracles.com/network-activation-program" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>apply here</u></a> before all the slots are booked (acceptance into the program is not guaranteed).</p>

<ul>
<li>ETH becomes deflationary.</li>



<li>Markets: Quiet weekend.</li>



<li>Visa partners with FTX.</li>



<li>Brasil goes after the “Crypto Sheik.”</li>
</ul>



<p>Good morning Banter Fam,</p>



<p>Ethereum experienced its first boat of deflationary tokenomics this weekend after a hyped project released its free-to-mint tokens. The culprit? Xen Crypto is a mysterious crypto project created by a former Google employee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The XEN token produced a spike of activity on the Ethereum blockchain when 349k participants minted the free tokens. Although minting was free, users paid for gas in ETH, and for the first time since the Merge, the ETH token became notably deflationary. The minters burned 2,157 ETH in 48 hours.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/0YIceVRfDM4pnW3PLzMZ5AyWCEwG51ID4Hr3JSEF_h9lD8bIRrDqdZ4Gt3LsYb4szWPmSHSP1rI7q_mNlB6J0V2yg_eDekVeV3Dnr5aHKOhIj0A2jDJUKkpP_zwnKKa9p1Lf13AjcMK8sOH2gcrbBv-D68tKcBPv6aKlVe5SRf5eiq45c9kLTgWi--dU0LLkXlQ" alt=""/></figure>

<p><em>Source: </em><a href="https://ultrasound.money/"><em>ultrasound.money</em></a></p>



<p>What&#8217;s impressive is how quickly Ethereum became deflationary after one hyped project burned more than a day&#8217;s supply issuance of ETH. Moreover, it provides a slight glance at ETH&#8217;s future when the chain begins experiencing increased demand.</p>



<p>Regarding Xen Crypto, it&#8217;s probably best if we all keep our distance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Market update</strong><strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f30d.png" alt="🌍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></h3>



<p><strong>BTC/USDT 1W</strong></p>



<p>It&#8217;s been nearly a month of BTC hovering around the $19.2K support zone and four months between $18.5K and $24.5K. BTC hadn&#8217;t experienced such a tight range for this long since May 2020, before the bull run kicked off. Trading volumes remain at all-time highs, indicating a structural basis change. Unless any major events unfold in macro, it&#8217;d be safe to assume BTC has exited a bearish cycle and entered a neutral cycle of accumulation and ranging price action. BTC completed the weekly candle up +2.01% to $19,439.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XayRUqkQgyUl24QzIn-WN6D0IeueFa3_rr41eF8bLh_Q6WXjzaDuh2xTcixraEGza8Yo6xtLuROjyXvACseI3i4qD7UdK9aS4eZRTz56_btscol80UbFzzK-siUnhCsXx-nAXnkbgO9e_3FeWkhuh5WBdUodXnD_K0U8WMwRNsLXXZWvBQCwfCqbJpvhZ9eEM1s" alt=""/></figure>

<p><strong>ETH/USD 1W</strong></p>



<p>Unlike its predecessor, ETH remains in a downtrend until the price breaks the major resistance trendline. Price has begun to consolidate on the weekly charts as it enters more deeply into a triangle pattern. Wait for a solid breakout to confirm the pattern, signaling an end to the downtrend. Historically, ETH tends to outperform BTC during these types of breakouts. ETH completed the weekly candle up +3.58% to $1,321.</p>

<p><strong>FTX and Visa.</strong> The crypto exchange FTX has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/07/visa-partners-with-ftx-in-a-bet-that-shoppers-still-want-to-spend-cryptocurrencies-in-a-bear-market.html">partnered</a> with Visa to release crypto-based debit cards across 40 nations within South America, Europe, and Asia. In an interview with CNBC, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried noted, &#8220;There&#8217;s a decision you have to make as a traditional payments company: do you want to lean into this or do you want to fight against it? I respect the fact that many of them are leaning into it.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Brasil issues warrants for the “Crypto Sheik”.</strong> The Brazilian courts have <a href="https://decrypt.co/111454/brazillian-police-raid-bitcoin-sheikh-defrauding-victims-766m">issued</a> over 20 warrants for Francisco Valdevino da Silva aka the &#8220;Crypto Sheik.&#8221; Hundreds of police officers in six cities were tasked with serving the search and seizure warrants across the country. Da Silva ran a crypto-based pyramid scheme that raised an estimated $767 million by promising high returns as far back as 2016.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Banter’s take</strong></h3>



<p>Another quiet weekend. That makes two in a row for the crypto markets. It highlights how macro-driven the markets are at the moment. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a fact of life we&#8217;ll have to live with for now.</p>



<p>Stay tuned this week for the Core PPI (inflation) print on October 12th and CPI y/y on the 13th. Both will significantly affect whether the Federal Reserve continues aggressive monetary tightening or considers loosening.</p>

<li>Inverse Cramer ETF?</li>
</ul>



<p>Good morning Banter Fam,</p>



<p>Cross-chain bridges are risky business!</p>



<p>The BNB network, closely tied to crypto exchange Binance, was exploited for an estimated $100 million on its cross-chain bridge, BSC Token Hub, yesterday. As a result, BNB paused the centralized chain to mitigate risk. Some were quick to call out BNB utilizing the power to halt the chain, but for the record, BNB never claimed to be decentralized. It has only 21 validators.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An exploit on a cross-chain bridge, BSC Token Hub, resulted in extra BNB. We have asked all validators to temporarily suspend BSC. The issue is contained now. Your funds are safe.

<p><strong>BTC/USDT 1D</strong></p>



<p>Today was a slightly bearish day on the BTC chart. BTC reached a high of $20,456 before being pulled back down by the US session. Markets were a mixed bag while the Dollar Index (DXY) showed strength, and the Fed&#8217;s Cook <a href="https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1578067598415208450?s=20&amp;t=kLoXbNov-89vTXkZ3WPYCA">continued</a> with a rhetoric of hawkish policy. BTC completed the daily candle down -0.98% to $19,960.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Banter’s take</strong></h3>



<p>How about a bit of Bitcoin history to end the week? New Liberty Standard, the first website to ever sell Bitcoin, went live precisely 13 years ago.</p>



<p>The creator of the site sold BTC at the average cost of mining it at the time. Buyers would purchase the BTC using PayPal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can you guess the cost? One dollar for 1,578 BTCs!</p>

<p>Since its launch in 2017 as a modest start-up, Travala.com is the top blockchain-based travel booking platform serving thousands of clients globally. Travala.com&#8217;s objective is to integrate decentralized technology with making travel reservations online in order to allow accessibility for everyone and everywhere. Their vision is to see censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer transactions via open-source technology that’s managed by users.</p>



<p>Established in May 2022 through the <a href="https://tdr.org/#/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>TRON DAO Reserve</u></a>, USDD is significantly different from other stablecoins in the crypto industry. It’s the first over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin, now with over $2 billion collateral backing the $792 million worth of USDD tokens in circulation. The vision for USDD is to provide a decentralized financial services ecosystem for everyone, especially those without access to the US dollar and banking systems utilizing it. The TRON DAO Reserve aims to safeguard the overall blockchain industry and crypto market, prevent panic trading caused by extreme events, and mitigate severe and long-term economic downturns. They saw USDD as one of the essential elements toward that end.</p>



<p>The total market cap of stablecoins on the TRON network is continuing to grow, paving the way for more developers to utilize them in their own projects. Travala is one of the many amazing projects seizing this opportunity to leverage stablecoins for the benefit of their users. USDD aims to continue positioning itself for further utility in hopes of a more decentralized, equitable world.</p>



<p><i><b>About USDD</b></i></p>



<p>USDD is an over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin launched collaboratively by the <a href="https://tdr.org/#/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>TRON DAO Reserve</u></a> and top-tier mainstream blockchain institutions. The USDD protocol runs on the <a href="https://tron.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>TRON network</u></a>, is connected to Ethereum and BNB Chain through the <a href="https://bttc.bittorrent.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>BTTC</u></a> cross-chain protocol, and will be accessible across more blockchains in the future. USDD is pegged to the US Dollar through TRX under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_exchange_rate_system_in_Hong_Kong" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Linked Exchange Rate System</u></a> (LERS) and maintains its price stability under the guidance of the TRON DAO Reserve. It enables access to a stable and decentralized digital dollar system that in turn assures financial liberty for everyone.</p>
